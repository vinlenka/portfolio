        <h2 class="title mb-3">About me</h2>
      </br>
        
        <div class="newspaper justify">
          <p class="mb-4">I grew up in Mumbai and moved between 3 cities during my schooling before moving to Bangalore for university and work. Now I call Bangalore my home. My childhood was mostly about having fun and playing for school football and tennis teams. I decided to take computer science in university by flipping a coin, but in hindsight that is one of the best ways I got lucky. </p>
          <p class="mb-4">I am by no means the best engineer but I have evolved into a very good product thinker and a young leader through my experiences. When I built my first product in university, I had the chance to pitch 1v1 to Mike Butcher from TechCrunch and he gave me the best advice I have got: <i>don’t add-up on features, focus on solving the problem properly</i>. </p>
          <p class="mb-4">I believe that great products are built by good ideas and exceptional teams. Three things in particular have enabled me in my journey to solve big challenges with my products:</p>
          <p class="mb-4"><strong><bold>Obsessive UX: </bold></strong>From my point of view, the most important thing is to CARE, and to understand how much do you genuinely care. I think care is very cheaply used these days. Genuine care is deep rooted by strong disgust or desire and a desperate feeling for wanting something better. Understanding the customer/ people who use your product the most and their natural behaviour has been the greatest input towards building my products.</p>
          <p class="mb-4"><strong><bold>Leaders make leaders: </bold></strong>In the first year of running Waymore, the amount of times I had zero balance in my account is crazy. At such desperate moments, you truly understand what it means to be a leader — the sense of responsibility and ownership is maximum, and my individual capacity has never grown so much. I want the same from and for the people who work with me. We’ve achieved this through continuously working on <i>building, protecting trust</i> and <i>fostering their talents</i> and <i>goals</i>.</p>
          <p class="mb-4"><strong><bold>Do what is necessary: </bold></strong>I launched my first company (a score keeping app) at 22 years-old and with no money to spend on marketing, I sat through all 92 matches replying to tweets on #IndianSuperLeague and in 2 months we had more than 15000 users. That was not only rewarding but also went onto shape my style of getting things done. At my current company (fashion, sustainability), I lead material innovation, sustainability + storytelling, and sales, all of which I’ve had no prior experiences in but a year into it, they’re all something I’ve become efficient at. </p>

              Waymore is a sustainable clothing initiative that makes clothing by recycling waste plastic bottles. We wanted to address the lack of an easy, responsible call to action for individuals to opt-in and contribute to fighting plastic pollution.
              We’ve recycled over 100,000 waste plastic bottles locally in India and our aim is to recycle 1 million waste plastic bottles by 2021.

            <p class="mb-4"> 
              Women experience a myriad of emotions when sexually harassed - pain, anger, vulnerability, confusion, helplessness, violation, depression to name a few. These are powerful expressions that the society often overlooks so we are building a medium to give them shape and fight sexual harassment.
            </p><p>The big question was what if we could get men to experience these emotions? We created See For She - a virtual reality experience where men experience sexual harassment in the body of a woman within a virtual space.
